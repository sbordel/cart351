          <h2>CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATION</h2>
          <!-- question 1 -->
          <div class="paragraphe" id="q1">
            <h3>→ What is your starting topic? What importance does it hold for you? For others? Why is it important to make this topic into an explorable networked space?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Keywords: GARDEN - COMMUNITY - GRID - VERTICAL - EXCHANGE - WEBBINGS</p>
            <br>
            <p>Community gardens are spaces where people gather to cultivate, disseminate and exchange resources, knowledge, and lived experience through the physical labor performed on and with the land itself. Gardening is a practice that holds a rich aesthetic value that materializes throughout the entire process, from the manipulation of the land to the sowing, the harvesting, and the consumption of the renderings.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In parallel, a popular concept that I’ve been fascinated with in the last few years is the Digital Garden, a nonlinear and flexible way to organize a website that echoes thought processes through webbings of hyperlinks and half-finished notes. For my project, I want to explore this topic in a more literal, aesthetical fashion with a focus on the process of what might be ‘virtual gardening’.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For the visual design of my project, I stem my inspiration from the practices of both grid or vertical gardening. In short, grid gardening is a compact, efficient yet healthy spacing technique meant to maximize crop production.<i>“The ‘grid’ represents the current culture of the Computer Age in a simple, easily understood, graphic form. It has been referenced in culture time and time again to signify the digital, firm control, the artificial world, computers, etc. [...] So, the Garden takes the grid as its basis and seeks to represent a space that begins under mechanical control and then evolves into a more chaotic natural state.”</i> Vertical gardening on the other hand involves growing plants on a vertically suspended panel. The end product is an organic abstract composition.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The reason I am so drawn to exploring the potential for gardens in a digitally explorable network is that community gardens - more specifically - are historically known to be sites for community healing (as much physical than mental) and are oriented around nurturing of self and others through the act of giving back to the land. These shared plots of land can offer us self-fulfillment, community bonding, and exchange, and produce (consumable or visual appeal). I find it interesting to consider how we can translate those fundamentals values from physical to virtual spaces – as we often, as a society, like to metaphorize technology through terms we’ve borrowed from nature.</p>
          </div>
          <!-- question 2 -->
          <div class="paragraphe" id="q2">
            <h3>→ Think about the kind of relationship you wish to encourage between your users and this space. How can you use this space to destabilize the users and make them reflect on themselves, their environment and society?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I view this project as a site for community building; a peer-to-peer network and would like to encourage users to nurture a communal digital space for which they’ve created the aesthetic foundation. This project relies on the idea of users interacting with the content - rather than with each other - for the garden to flourish and grow. I view it as a way of challenging our approach to social media, for example, by shifting away from more direct forms of communication by experimenting with alternatives that support no specific goal in mind other than to actively participate in a shared space and activity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have acknowledged through personal experience that my relationship to the web has drastically changed over time: what used to be an activity filled with amazement has now become a tool for work, with my online activity always being tied to reaching a certain goal or accessing commodities. It has lost much of its wonder, its excitement, and its unpredictability where aimless web surfing time has come to trigger feelings of anxiety and shame. In a time where capitalism has infected most areas of our life, even to creep up in our leisure time, I would like to create a space that encourages the user to enter without any constraining expectations and invite them to participate if they so wish to.</p>
          </div>
          <!-- question 3 -->
          <div class="paragraphe" id="q3">
            <h3>→ Think about the notion of empowerment. Will your "space" help, challenge, teach, enable collaboration, understanding between user(s)? How and Why?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I am hoping that this project will offer a space in which users feel enabled to collaborate. To do so, the project will have to display that the contribution of their images to the project will serve as assets in a creative process that will then render a visual and interactive composition - a digital garden.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Image contributions and interactions with the garden will allow it to grow denser and flourish, delivering a visual rendition of the user's collective input and activity.</p>

            <h3>A Field Guide to Roadside Flowers at Full Speed</h3>
            <h4>by Chris Helzer</h4>
            <a href="https://prairieecologist.com/2020/01/13/finally-a-practical-guide-for-roadside-wildflower-viewing/" target="_blank"><img class="link-img" src="../assets/link-icon.png" alt="link to project"></a>
            <img class="ref" src="../assets/project_refs/afieldguide_ChrisHelzer.png" alt="A Field Guide [...] by Chris Helzer">
            <p>This book written by Chris Helzer is a playful yet non-ironically practical guide to identify roadside wildflowers at full speed (as in, when you are sight viewing through your passenger window during a long drive). “A Field Guide to Roadside Flowers at Full Speed” is a guide meant for site-specific anthophiles - those who only really have time to gaze at flowers through their car window during a drive. “At long last, I have bravely stepped into the void to create the wildflower guide that has been missing for as long as field guides and automobiles have awkwardly co-existed on this earth.“ Similar to how we watch Slow TV videos via our computer screens, Helzer’s book offers a perspective on our relationship with nature by means of a non-human intermediary. Our vicarious dependency on technology is possibly a result of our deficiency in outdoor activities or a need to indulge in these sometimes inaccessible landscapes and spaces.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As for the visual content of this guide, I find the stills of horizontally motion-blurred flowers to be quite pretty. Each capture’s blur movement is different and offers an interesting body of abstract floral images.</p>

            <h3>Delightful Vistas: Revisiting the Hypertext Garden</h3>
            <h4>by Mark Bernstein</h4>
            <a href="https://muse-jhu-edu.lib-ezproxy.concordia.ca/chapter/459203" target="_blank"><img class="link-img" src="../assets/link-icon.png" alt="link to project"></a>
            <img class="ref" src="../assets/project_refs/HypertextGarden_MarkBernstein.png" alt="HypertextGarden by Mark Bernstein">
            <p>Initially conceived as a website, Mark Beinstein’s essay “Delightful Vistas [...]” explores the semantics, utility, and integration of hypertext in its analogy with garden design. He goes through the use of hypertext across a timeline, explaining why and how its implementation has evolved and offers future sites of possibilities to explore. While the original website itself is very archaic and janky (although it is very evocative of its time), his ideas remain relevant and important to how we approach web design and the use of hyperlinks today.</p>
            <br>
            <p>His essay serves as a framework to what we now call digital gardens: from the hypertext we create and link, to the way we organize our content in the confined screen space, and the limits or potential of the networks we can create by means of hyperlinks.</p>

            <h3>Queering the Map</h3>

            <a href="https://www.queeringthemap.com/" target="_blank"><img class="link-img" src="../assets/link-icon.png" alt="link to project"></a>
            <img class="ref" src="../assets/project_refs/queeringthemap_LucasLarochelle.png" alt="Queering the Map by Lucas Larochelle">
            <p>Queering the Map is an interactive world map filled with queer stories, messages, and notes told by community members. Using the Google Map API as its canvas, this platform serves as a way to reclaim the space digitally, perhaps as a counterattack to the exclusion that has been (and continues to be) lived by queer communities in the physical world. While the users are invited to share some of their kinkiest of stories, volunteer moderators are in charge of filtering the content that is posted to the map in order to assure that this project remains a safe space clear from any homophobia, transphobia, racism, or any other forms of discrimination.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In some way, this project could be interpreted as a digital garden. The map is set by a team of community organizers. They allow members to contribute and archive pieces of their history on the virtual land, within certain boundaries in order to preserve communal respect and safety, allowing previously unheard voices to be heard, and to feel validated. Queering the map is a space that promotes acknowledgment and love of the self and others. It offers food for thought. It offers us the possibility to reflect on relationships that are not our own, but that we might relate to or learn from.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="paragraphe" id="pp4">
            Inspired by these projects, I will attempt to consolidate some of the topics these artists have tackled with my own collection of thoughts and ideas, to create a community generated digital garden, informed by the relationship between society, ecology and technology.
